  <tr><td>lobsters are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster#Longevity">biologically immortal</a>. broadly speaking, lobsters cannot die of old age in the same way that humans can, and most of them die either due to resource exhaustion while moulting, or due to not being able to moult any more, in which case either their exoskeleton collapses and they are vulnerable to injury, or they are crushed alive inside their exoskeleton as they grow.</td></tr>
