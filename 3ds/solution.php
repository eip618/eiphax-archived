        <p><div class="blue">This short guide is intended to offer a guaranteed solution to any problem you may be having with your console or device.
        <br>It is failsafe, foolproof and works 100% of the time.</div>
        <hr><p>Here is the solution:
        <ol>
            <li>Stop doing it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It may sound counterproductive, but if you are having a problem trying to do something, no longer trying to do it will solve your problem. Here are a few examples.
        <ul>
            <li>If you are having trouble installing CFW on your console, stop trying to install CFW.</li>
            <li>If you are finding it difficult to repair a broken item, stop trying to repair it.</li>
            <li>If it is hard for you to reverse parallel park, stop trying to reverse parallel park.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I think by now you understand how easy it can be to solve any problem you have. Thank you for visiting eipHax.
