		<p><h3>Missing Hax</h3>There could be several reasons for this.
		<ol>
			<li>You did not copy the patched DSiWare bin back to your SD card.</li>
			<li>You did not copy it back to the "Nintendo DSiWare" folder on your SD card.</li>
			<li>You mistakenly copied back the clean version.</li>
			<li>The file is not named correctly.</li>
			<li>The file is corrupted.</li>

	<div class="box2 hidden" id="fred3">
		<br><h3>Black Screen</h3>This may indicate that your TWLfirm is unusable. Ordinarily, this would have been ruled out at the beginning of the guide with a TWLfirm test. You should try to copy over the patched DSiWare again, in case it was a bad copy. Failing that, ask for help on the <a href="https://discord.gg/dQgV6ZG">Nintendo Homebrew</a> Discord.
	</div>
	<div class="box2 hidden" id="fred4">
		<br><h3>Fredtool</h3>Generally, the only reason Fredtool will fail is if the movable is incorrect for the DSiWare provided, or if the DSiWare is incorrect for the movable provided. Check your inputs and be sure you are not getting the wrong movable matched up with the wrong DSiWare.<br>Another common cause is that you downloaded "movable_part1.sed" and renamed it "movable.sed". This will not work. Go back to bruteforcemovable and click the green "Continue" button, then download the movable.sed and try again. Failing that, ask for help on the <a href="https://discord.gg/dQgV6ZG">Nintendo Homebrew</a> Discord.

		<br><h3>Lenny on Vacation</h3>You're missing the "T00031_1038C2A757B77_000.ppm" file from a specific place on your SD card. Allow me to explain.
		<p><img src="pic/priv.png"> <i>This IS correct.</i>
		<p>This folder and file path is correct, and how your folder should look when you open it. The "private" folder goes on your SD root, by itself.
		<br>Here are some common mistakes. These are <b>NOT</b> correct.
		<p><img src="pic/priv2.png"> <i>This is NOT correct.</i>
		<p><img src="pic/priv3.png"> <i>This is NOT correct.</i>
		<p>These are examples only. There are many ways to screw this up. The first image is the only correct folder and file path. Make sure yours matches it.
		<br><a href="https://github.com/zoogie/Frogminer/releases/tag/v1.0">Here's where you can get the .ppm file.</a>

		<br><h3>Frozen!</h3>There's a pretty good chance you've accidentally drawn on the notes before merging the two glitched notes together.
		<p><ol>
			<li>Close the application. You might be able to press Home, and close it normally. If you can't, hold the Power button until the console dies.</li>
			<li>Power back on.</li>
			<li>If you are using Frogtool, launch Download Play.<br>If you are using Fredtool, go to System Settings > Internet Settings > DS Connection Settings.</li>
			<li>You should now see Japanese Flipnote again. Follow the steps again and be careful not to draw on the notes before merging them.</li>

		<br><h3>Whiteout</h3>Something's up with your files. You should replace b9stool (boot.nds) on your SD card root, as it may be corrupted.<br>If that doesn't fix it, have a look at <a href="./sderrors.html">this</a>.<br>If that still doesn't fix it, or the test returns problems, you should switch SD cards.
	</div>
	<div class="box2 hidden" id="flip4">
		<br><h3>Green Screen</h3>Likely, you are missing b9stool in the root, or "boot.nds". You should refer back to your guide and get the latest release of this tool.<br>If you are sure that it is there, your SD card may also be bad. Try testing it <a href="sderrors.html">here.</a>

		<br><h3>Missing Lenny 2</h3>The most common cause of this problem is that you are using a Chromebook or a Macbook/MacOS device. Let me explain a bit here.
		<br>Every operating system handles merging folders of the same name differently. On Windows, merging two folders will cause Windows to compare the contents and ask you which set you want to keep if any conflict.
		<br>On MacOS and Chromebooks, trying to move a "private" folder to a place where there is already a "private" folder will rename the new folder "private-2".
		<br>Here is an illustration of what this might look like.
		<p><img src="./pic/flip1.png">
		<p>In this image, <div class="code">Set 1</div> is the already-existing "private" folder. <div class="code">Set 2</div> is the new "private" folder that you are trying to use for the Flipnote exploit.
		<br>What you need to do is to delete the files in <div class="code">Set 1</div> (dirmemo.lst, mark0.pls, etc) so that the "001" folder is empty.
		<br>Then, take the "T00031[...].ppm" file from <div class="code">Set 2</div> and put it in the "001" folder in <div class="code">Set 1</div>. Here is how it might look.
		<p><img src="./pic/flip2.png">
		<p>Once you have put the .ppm file in the right place, you can try launching the Flipnote exploit again.

	<h3>No crash</h3>
	<br>Usually, this error is caused by the exploit DSiWare (F00D43D5.bin) being misplaced.
	<p><img src="pic/bb1.png">
	<p>This is an example of an <b>incorrect</b> placement. In this example, the 30ff... folder, outlined in blue, is the ID0. The c7aa... folder, outlined in red, is the ID1. The Nintendo DSiWare folder must be INSIDE the ID1.
	<p><img src="pic/bb2.png">
	<p>This is another example of <b>incorrect</b> placement. Here, the exploit DSiWare (F00D43D5.bin) exists, but is not placed in the DSiWare folder.
	<p><img src="pic/bb3.png">
	<p>This example is <b>correct</b> placement. The exploit DSiWare exists, is in the right folder, and the folder is inside the ID0 and ID1.
		</div>
	<div class="box hidden" id="bb2">
	<h3>General crash</h3>
	<br>Usually, this is caused by trying to use the exploit DSiWare (F00D43D5.bin) with Fredtool. You have to use the exploit DSiWare to get a proper DSiWare dump, and the dump you get from that process is the dump you use with Fredtool.
	<br>Have another read of the <a href="./bb3.html">BannerBomb3</a> guide and do the process properly.
	<br>Also, ensure that the exploit DSiWare (F00D43D5.bin) is the only .bin file in your Nintendo DSiWare folder. Having more than one DSiWare in there can sometimes mess up the exploit.
