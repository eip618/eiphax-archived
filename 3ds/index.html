        Hello and welcome to Eip's Homebrew Index.
        <br>
        This site will attempt to host and maintain a collection of useful links and information related to 3DS Homebrew.
        <p>
        If you follow any of the guides or suggestions on this page, please ensure you read the instructions once or twice over to ensure you have understood them. The most common cause of problems with hacked consoles is user error or misunderstanding, and I don't mean that lightly.
		<br>If you have problems, make a Discord account and join <a href="https://discord.gg/dQgV6ZG" target=”_blank”>this server</a>, and ask for assistance in the assistance channels.
		<br>Thanks to all my friends on Nintendo Homebrew for helping me with the information here, thanks to Jisagi for some Javascript, and thanks to Zeta for letting me (poorly) steal their CSS.
		<p>Here is a <a href="./privacy.html">privacy statement</a> for this website.
        <p>The first, and possibly most important link, is <a href="http://3ds.hacks.guide" target=”_blank”>Plailect's Guide.</a> Plailect's guide is regularly updated, verified to be accurate and is comprehensive across all software and hardware versions.<br>Plailect's guide is used primarily for the purpose of installing custom firmware (CFW). CFW is a beefier, better, more stable version of homebrew. With the advent of Seedminer and its related exploits, CFW is now free and available on version 11.10, so there's almost no reason to stay on homebrew-only.
		<p>There is a new, fancy, wide-ranging exploit called <a href="./seedminer.html">Seedminer!</a> Seedminer is compatible with all regions on software version 11.10.
        <p>If you want Homebrew-only access, it's recommended to use Pichaxx. Steelhax (legacy method) still works, but is deprecated by Pichaxx. Pichaxx can be found in the first section of the <a href="./dsidump.html">DSiWare Dumper guide.</a>
		
        <p><a href="./tips.html" target=”_blank”>What can I do with CFW?</a>
        <p>
        If you are interested in the technical side of things, <a href="https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Main_Page" target=”_blank”>3dbrew</a> is a comprehensive resource with lots of details and information.
        <p>I also have a page on <a href="./piracy.html">piracy</a> as it relates to the 3DS and the Nintendo Homebrew server, a brief guide for the <a href=".\nsui.html">New Super Ultimate Injector</a>, a <a href="./seedfaq.html">FAQ</a> for Seedminer and a page on how to <a href="./sderrors.html">comprehensively check your SD card for errors</a>, which I would probably recommend doing before you start with any of these processes but that's just, like, my opinion, man. I also offer a <a href="./solution.html">guaranteed solution</a> to any problems you may be having, a page full of <a href="./what.html" target="_blank">explanations</a> and some <a href="./catalyst.html" target="_blank">starter kits</a> for hacking your console. Now with added <a href="issues.html">troubleshooting.</a>
        <br>This entire website should be considered a permanent WIP, but LOOK MA I HAVE CSS NOW.
